    <h2>Why Have Fun Outdoor</h2>
</p>

<p>The Benefits of Outdoor Play. </p>
Playing outdoors is a form of exercise that promotes well-being and wholesome physical development.
<br> Children are naturally drawn to active play outdoors: it allows them to explore their environment, develop muscle strength
and coordination, and gain self-confidence.

<h2>How to Make Friends</h2>
Every friendship begins with some sign that two people are interested in becoming friends.
<br> So, the first ingredient for making friends involves showing that we like someone and expressing openness to friendship
with them.
<h4>Greetings</h4>
A very basic way to show openness is to greet potential friends.
<h4>Compliments</h4>
Compliments are another easy way to signal openness to friendship
<h4>Kindness</h4>

Small kindnesses can be another way to signal liking.
<br> This could mean lending a pencil to a classmate, saving them a seat, helping them carry something, or sharing a lunch treat.
<br> Kindness tends to elicit kindness, and itâ€™s one of the best ways to begin a friendship.
<br>
<p>Expressing openness is the first ingredient of friendship formation, because it casts wide the metaphorical door to friendship.</p>
